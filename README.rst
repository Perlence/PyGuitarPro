Introduction
------------

PyGuitarPro is a package to read, write and manipulate GP3, GP4 and GP5 files. Initially PyGuitarPro is a Python port
of `AlphaTab`_ which is a Haxe port of `TuxGuitar`_.

.. _AlphaTab: http://www.alphatab.net/
.. _TuxGuitar: http://tuxguitar.herac.com.ar/

This package helps you achieve several goals you might find yourself yearning to do in a day-to-day tabber life:

- transpose a track without messing the fingering.

- add first string to the track without messing the fingering.

- map percussion notes to different values.

Reading ``.gp*`` files is as easy as:

.. code-block:: python

   import guitarpro
   curl = guitarpro.parse('Mastodon - Curl of the Burl.gp5')

Writing ``.gp*`` files isn't that hard as well:

.. code-block:: python

   guitarpro.write(curl, 'Mastodon - Curl of the Burl 2.gp5')

All objects representing GP entities are hashable and comparable. This gives the great opportunity to apply *diff*
algorithm to tabs, or even *diff3* algorithm to merge tablatures.

To anyone wanting to create their the best guitar tablature editor in Python this package will be the good thing to
start with.
